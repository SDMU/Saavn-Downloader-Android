Saavn Downloader - Android
====
This is an Android app which i coded after when i discovered a loophole in Saavn Android App (a popular music streaming app) which can be used to download any music from Saavn in mp3 format, AFAIK only Pro users can download songs but that are also DRM protected (i will tell you how broken that is), but with any user can bypass all these protection and get DRM free music on their disk.

I mailed them about this issue several time and and waited for their reply but they paid no notice so here is my tiny litle downloader that i coded.

For more info on how it all started see my other respository https://github.com/arunKumarNOP/Saavn-Downloader


Building
====
Use Android Studio (i used version 2.2.3 at the time of writing and build tools) or gradle from command line to build it nothing fancy in this. Or Google it if you don't know how to build it.

I will not be releasing any pre build apks.
